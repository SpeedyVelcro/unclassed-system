Attributes govern a character's general capabilities and affect nearly all
aspects of gameplay. All skill checks include an attribute in their formulae,
and some attributes have direct impacts on specific aspects of gameplay.

While the Skills chapter (see pg. \ref{skills}) covers the effect of attributes
on skill checks, this chapter outlines the direct impact of attributes on
gameplay. A summary can be found in table \ref{tab:attributes}.

\subsection{Character Creation}
All physical and mental attributes start at 0. Characters start without any
special attributes, which can be marked with a hyphen (-) on your character
sheet. In order to gain special attributes, you will usually need a specific
feat.

During character creation, you will raise and lower your attributes by 
selecting a species (see pg. \ref{species}), culture (see pg. \ref{species}),
background (see pg. \ref{background}), and feats (see pg. \ref{feats}).

The effect of these choices on your attributes are detailed in their respective
chapters.


% NB: Commented out below is an earlier system for generating starting
% attributes
%\section{Starting Attributes}

%Generate a character's starting attributes using one of the following methods:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Refer to table \ref{tab:point-buy}, and choose values for all your
%        attributes, summing up to a maximum of 60 points. This is the
%        recommended method.
%        % NB: The point buy for a peasant would be 24, as they have all 0s,
%        % except sorcery, which would be -3.
%    \item Set each attribute to -6, then for each attribute roll 4d4 and add
%        the sum of the highest 3 dice. You may then swap any attributes you
%        choose. This method skews towards more powerful characters than
%        point buy, but comes with a risk of lower attributes.
%    \item As above, but you are not allowed to swap attributes. This method
%        makes every character a surprise.
%\end{itemize}
%Your GM may require you to use a specific method, so check before generating
%your attributes.
