Academia encompasses a character's ability to study, research, and learn.
Where knowledge skills cover what a character already knows, academia allows
them to find out more.

\subsubsection*{Research}
The academia skill allows a character to do research at a library. Such a
skill check requires a day of time spent at the library. The target is set
exactly as it is for knowledge skills (pg. \pageref{knowledge}).

Libraries have knowledge ratings that determine what information they have.
These ratings cap the information that can be gleaned at 20 plus the rating.
For example, a library with a knowledge (astronomy) rating of 4 can only be used
to discover astronomy facts that could be gleaned by a knowledge (astronomy)
check of 24 or less.

\subsubsection*{Training}
Academia is used when training spell schools or mental, thievery, or
speechcraft skills.

When commencing training in any such skill, make an
academia skill check. Subtract the result from the number of days required to
train the skill if self-studying. If training with a trainer, instead subtract
a quarter of the result rounded down.

An academia skill check can only be made once to train a particular skill to a
particular rating. Once the academia skill check is made, the training time
reduction for that skill and rating is "locked in" and cannot be made again.

Training time cannot be reduced to less than 1 day with an academia skill
check.
