The focus skill is used to concentrate on a task, particularly in distracting
or dangerous conditions.

\subsubsection*{Training}
Focus is used when training athletic, physical, combat, or weapon skills.

When commencing training in any such skill, make a
focus skill check. Subtract the result from the number of days required to
train the skill if self-studying. If training with a sparring partner, instead
subtract half the result rounded down, and a quarter instead if self-studying.

A focus skill check can only be made once to train a particular skill to a
particular rating. Once the focus skill check is made, the training time
reduction for that skill and rating is "locked in" and cannot be made again.

Training time cannot be reduced to less than 1 day with an focus skill
check.
