\begin{multicols}{2}
    A skill governs a character's ability to do a specific chance, usually
    impacting their chance of success. For example, a character with a high
    lockpicking skill is more likely to succeed at picking a lock on a chest.

    Skills include things you might expect such as climbing or lockpicking,
    however in the Unclassed System almost everything you do is governed by
    skill checks. For instance, rather than bespoke attack rolls, you make
    a skill check for the weapon you are using. Rather than making a saving
    throw to dodge a trap, you make a dodge skill check. Rather than making
    a saving throw to resist mind control, you make a discipline skill check.
    For this reason, the Unclassed System has a very large list of skills.

    All skills have a rating which starts at 0. This rating determines how
    good a character is at that skill. If a character's rating in a skill is
    0, that character is said to be "untrained" in that skill. They can still
    use that skill, but they use a default value in place of the skill's
    rating. This value is in the "Def." column of table \ref{tab:skills}.

    \section{Using Skills}
    When a player declares what they want to do, the GM may call for a skill
    check. To make a skill check, the player rolls 1d20 and calculates the
    result using the following formula, substituting "skill rating" for the
    default if the rating is 0:

    \begin{center}
        Skill check = 1d20 + governing attribute + skill rating (+ modifiers)
    \end{center}

    The skill check is successful if it meets a particular target value. This
    may be a set value for a particular task as outlined in this chapter, it
    may be set by the GM, or it may be based on an opposed skill check made at
    the same time by another character. Unless otherwise noted, the skill
    check must be more than or equal to this target value to be successful.

    \section{Potential}
    All skills have a potential. This is the number in the "Pot."
    column of table \ref{tab:skills}. A skill can only be raised as high as
    its potential.

    Whenever a character levels up, they raise the potential of a number of
    skills equal to their INT by 1. A character cannot pick the same skill more
    than once per level. No matter how low their INT, a character always raises
    the potential of at least 1 skill in this way.

    \section{Skill Points}
    On character creation, a character starts with a number of skill points
    equal to 12 + (INT $\times$ 8). Each skill point can be spent to increase
    a skill's rating by 1, up to a maximum of that skill's potential.

    Characters do not gain skill points as they level up. Instead, they must
    train in order to raise their skills. If creating a character at a higher
    level than 1, you should simulate training by spending the character's
    extra starting gold and adding any time spent training to the character's
    age.

    \section{Training}
    To improve skills after character creation, a character must train. This
    takes time and potentially money or resources.

    The easiest way to train is to find a trainer - a non-player character
    who has a higher skill rating and is willing to train the character.
    Training with a trainer takes a number of days listed in the "Training"
    column of table \ref{tab:skills}, and most trainers charge a daily fee
    for training. In the absence of any other factors that would affect the
    price, the GM may use the formula below:

    \begin{center}
        Training Fee = (Trainer's skill rating + Trainer's Teaching skill rating) $\times$ 1 sp / day
    \end{center}

    Characters can also self-study to train any skill without a trainer.
    Certain skills require access to specific resources for self-study, and
    these are listed in the respective skill descriptions. Self-study takes 4
    times as long as training with a trainer. This multiplication is done
    before applying any other time reductions.

    Weapon and combat skills can be trained with a special kind of self study
    called sparring. Sparring is a two-person activity, and each character
    involved can train a weapon or combat skill of their choice. They do not
    have to train the same skill. Sparring takes 2 times as long as training
    with a trainer, instead of the usual 4.

    Spell schools and mental, thievery, and speechcraft skills can have their
    training time reduced using the academia skill (see pg. \pageref{skill:academia}).
    Athletic, physical, combat, and weapon skills can similarly have their training
    time reduced using the focus skill (see pg. \pageref{skill:focus}). If
    training with a trainer, the trainer reduces the time spent training using
    the teaching skill (see pg. \pageref{skill:teaching}).

    \section{Athletic Skills}
    Athletic skills are those which involve physical exertion, such as running
    or jumping. Training physical skills uses the focus skill.

    \section{Physical Skills}
    Physical skills use the functions of the body to perform basic tasks. The
    most important physical skills are the senses, such as vision and hearing,
    but there are other useful physical skills such as breath control.

    Physical skills are trained using the focus skill.

    \section{Mental Skills}
    Mental skills are those that involve using the mind in a mundane (i.e. not
    supernatural, magical, or psionic) way. Training mental skills uses the
    academia skill.

    \import{./skills/}{knowledge}

    \section{Thievery Skills}
    Thievery skills are typically practiced by thieves and rogues, and
    encompass those skills which are particularly suited for stealthy
    gameplay. Thievery skills are trained using the focus skill.

    \section{Speechcraft Skills}\label{speechcraft-skills}
    Speechcraft skills govern interactions with other characters using language.
    You must speak the same language as a character to use a speechcraft skill.

    Many speechcraft skills have modifiers according to discrimination or fear of
    a species, culture, or background. These only apply if the target is aware and
    convinced of the character's species, culture, or background. For species and
    culture, this is is usually as simple as seeing the character or hearing the
    character talk, but for background, this may require some persuasion or
    deception.
    
    Training speechcraft skills uses the academia skill.

    \section{Combat Skills}
    Combat skills are a specific set of skills that are used in combat to pull
    of unique maneuvers other than simple attacks (which are governed by weapon
    skills). Training combat skills uses the focus skill.

    \section{Weapon Skills}\label{weapon-skills}
    Characters have weapon skills in each type of weapon. Weapon skills are used in
    combat. As there is not much else they can be used for, weapon skills are only
    listed in table \ref{tab:skills}.

    Training weapon skills uses the focus skill.

    \section{Spell Schools}\label{spell-schools}
    Skills for spell schools are used in the casting of spells. If a spell requires
    a skill check, it will be mentioned in the spell's description. As spell
    schools have no further use beyond casting spells, they are only listed in
    table \ref{tab:skills}.

    Training spell schools uses the academia skill.
