    A skill governs a character's ability to do a specific chance, usually
    impacting their chance of success. For example, a character with a high
    lockpicking skill is more likely to succeed at picking a lock on a chest.

    Skills include things you might expect such as climbing or lockpicking,
    however in the Unclassed System almost everything you do is governed by
    skill checks. For instance, rather than bespoke attack rolls, you make
    a skill check for the weapon you are using. Rather than making a saving
    throw to dodge a trap, you make a dodge skill check. Rather than making
    a saving throw to resist mind control, you make a discipline skill check.
    For this reason, the Unclassed System has a very large list of skills.

    Skills have a rating that represents a character's aptitude at that skill.
    This rating usually starts at 0, but some skills (particularly weapon
    and thievery skills) start at negative ratings. The starting rating for
    a given skill is the first number in the "Starting" column of table
    \ref{tab:skills}.

    \section{Using Skills}
    When a player declares what they want to do, the GM may call for a skill
    check. To make a skill check, the player rolls 1d20 and calculates the
    result using the following formula:

    \begin{center}
        Skill check = 1d20 + governing attribute + skill rating (+ modifiers)
    \end{center}

    The skill check is successful if it meets a particular target value. This
    may be a set value for a particular task as outlined in this chapter, it
    may be set by the GM, or it may be based on an opposed skill check made at
    the same time by another character. Unless otherwise noted, the skill
    check must be more than or equal to this target value to be successful.

    \section{Potential}
    All skills have a potential. This is the second number in the "Starting"
    column of table \ref{tab:skills}. A skill can only be raised as high as
    its potential.

    Whenever a character levels up, they raise the potential of a number of
    skills equal to their INT by 1. A character cannot pick the same skill more
    than once per level. No matter how low their INT, a character always raises
    the potential of at least 1 skill in this way.

    \section{Skill Points}
    On character creation, a character starts with a number of skill points
    equal to 12 + (INT $\times$ 8). Each skill point can be spent to increase
    a skill's rating by 1, up to a maximum of that skill's potential.

    Characters do not gain skill points as they level up. Instead, they must
    train in order to raise their skills. If creating a character at a higher
    level than 1, you should simulate training by spending the character's
    extra starting gold and adding any time spent training to the character's
    age.

    \section{Speechcraft Skills}\label{speechcraft-skills}
    Speechcraft skills govern interactions with other characters using language.
    You must speak the same language as a character to use a speechcraft skill.

    Many speechcraft skills have modifiers according to discrimination or fear of
    a species, culture, or background. These only apply if the target is aware and
    convinced of the character's species, culture, or background. For species and
    culture, this is is usually as simple as seeing the character or hearing the
    character talk, but for background, this may require some persuasion or
    deception.

    \section{Combat Skills}

    \section{Weapon Skills}\label{weapon-skills}
    Characters have weapon skills in each type of weapon. Weapon skills are used in
    combat. As there is not much else they can be used for, weapon skills are only
    listed in table \ref{tab:skills}.

    \section{Spell Schools}\label{spell-schools}
    Skills for spell schools are used in the casting of spells. If a spell requires
    a skill check, it will be mentioned in the spell's description. As spell
    schools have no further use beyond casting spells, they are only listed in
    table \ref{tab:skills}.
