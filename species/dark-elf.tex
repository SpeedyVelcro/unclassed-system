\section{Dark Elf}\index{dark elf}\label{dark-elf}
Dark elves are a subset of elves adapted to a permanent lifestyle underground.
They have red or purple eyes and skin colors ranging from light grey to pitch
black. In some settings are feared or discriminated against.

In some settings dark elves do not live underground. If this is the case, dark
elves should be an ethnicity with no mechanical differences from elves rather
than a distinct species with dark vision.
