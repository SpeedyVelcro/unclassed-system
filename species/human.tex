\section{Human}\index{human}\label{human}
Humans are the baseline. They are exactly as they are in our world, and have
none of the physical or supernatural advantages of other species. In most
settings, humans are more successful than the other species due to either
cultural reasons or simply sheer numbers.

Humans are given extra feat points at character creation. This does not
represent anything special about humans, but is instead given as a bonus for
picking a species without any physical or supernatural advantages.
