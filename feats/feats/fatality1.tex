% Justification for the distribution of point costs for Fatality feats:
%
% Most weapons have threat ranges of 19-20 or 18-20. If you take the fatality
% feats in both of these cases, the percentage chance of a critical hit is
% increased by the following amounts:
%
% Fatality  19-20   18-20
% I         1.25    1.75
% II        1.75    2.25
% III       2.25    2.75
% IV        2.75    3.25
% V         3.25    3.75
%
% (The relevant graph is y = ((x / 20)^2) * 100 where the x-axis is critical
% range and the y-axis is % chance)
%
% A point cost pattern of I: 1, II: 2, III: 2, IV: 3, V: 3 fits the patterns
% for both 19-20 and 18-20, albeit with different methods of rounding, so it
% seems roughly fair regardless of your starting critical ranage (at least for
% the common ones)
%
% This is probably a pretty stupid justification and an egregious abuse of
% mathematics, but at the very least the result satisfies the goal of
% balancing the following:
% - Not letting critical range get out of hand for cheap
% - Not letting the point cost get so out of hand that you would never consider
%   these feats.

All your attacks have the size of their critical range increased by 1. For
example, an attack with a weapon that has a critical range of 19-20 would have
its critical range increased to 18-20.
