\subsection{Toughness V}\label{feat:toughness5}

\noindent
\textbf{Prerequisites:} Toughness IV

\noindent
\textbf{Point Cost:} 4 

Your health die becomes d20. If you take this feat after first level, add 4X to
your maximum health where X is your level. If your GM requires you to roll for
health on level up, instead add Xd9 + 8 - X where X is your level minus one.

NB: The rolled formula above is extremely unusual and may require a dice
simulator that supports exotic dice. If the GM wishes to avoid this
requirement, they should allow average health on level up at least for this
feat.
