    Feats are permanent effects you can add to your character during character creation (see
    pg. \ref{character-creation}) and during level-up (see pg.
    \ref{advancement}).

    There are two types of feats: positive and negative. Positive feats give
    bonuses and can be selected during character creation \textit{or} level-up.
    Negative feats can \textit{only} be selected during level-up, and apply
    penalties to your character.

    During character creation you can select a maximum number of positive
    feats - usually exactly 1. There is no limit to the number of negative
    feats you can select.

    Selecting a negative feat increases your maximum number of positive feats
    by 1. You can increase your maximum number of positive feats by up to
    4 in this way. Further negative feat selections no longer increase your
    maximum number of positive feats.

    The above rules on maximums do not apply to level-ups, where you select
    exactly one feat, positive or negative.
