    Feats are permanent effects you can add to your character during character
    creation (see pg. \ref{character-creation}) and during level-up (see pg.
    \ref{advancement}).

    Feats have a feat point cost associated with them. You must spend feat
    points to unlock them. Most charcters get 1 feat point at character
    creation, plus any extra gained from their species, culture and background.

    Flaws are a special kind of feat you can only chose during character
    creation. Rather than costing feat points, flaws give you extra feat
    points to spend. Up to 4 extra feat points can be gained this way, after
    which any further flaws do not give extra feat points.
