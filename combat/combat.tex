\begin{itemize}
    \item Attacker makes an attack roll (weapon skill check)
    \item Defender makes a defence roll (dodge, block, or parry check)
    \item If the attack roll is less than or equal to the defense roll, the
            attack fails. Otherwise, subtract the defense roll from the
            attack roll.
    \item If the remainder of the attack roll is less than or equal to the
            defender's armor rating, the armor's damage reduction will be
            subtracted from the attack damage.
    \item Roll for damage
    \item Subtract damage reduction if applicable
    \item Apply damage
\end{itemize}
