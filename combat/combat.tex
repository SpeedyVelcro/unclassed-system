    Combat in the Unclassed System is turn-based; each round, characters take
    turns in a specific order determined by initiative. Each character can
    take a default of 1 \textonehalf\ actions during their turn.

    Notice the extra \textonehalf\ action. Most characters will make 1 important
    action per turn - such as attacking or casting a spell - and then make a
    smaller \textonehalf\ action - such as moving half their speed or drawing a
    weapon. Actions can be done in any order, for example a character may first
    take a \textonehalf\ action to draw their sword and then take 1 action to
    attack. Any combination of actions can be taken up to a character's
    allottment of actions for that turn. For example, it is perfectly valid
    to take no actions or to take 3 separate \textonehalf\ actions in a turn.

    The length of various actions is listed on table \ref{tab:combat-actions}.

    One round represents 6 seconds of combat, however the turn system is an
    abstraction of this time. Although in game terms characters take turns to
    act, all the turns in a round are considered, in a narrative sense, to have
    some overlap. The order of turns is simply a representation of who's fast
    enough to make the first serious impact in combat.

    \section{Initiative}
    The order of turns in combat is determined by initiative. Each character
    involved in combat makes an initiative check at the start of combat by
    rolling 1d20 and adding their initiative modifier. By default, a
    character's initiative modifier is DEX + SEN, representing both the acrity
    of their senses and the speed at which their body reacts.

    Characters act in turn starting from the highest initiative and going to
    the lowest. Where two or more characters have the same initiative, ties
    are broken by the following heirarchy:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Player characters and their allies go first
        \item Characters with the highest initiative modifier go first
        \item Characters who are still tied make another initiative check,
            following the tie-breaking steps again if necessary..
            This is not used as their actual initiative, but is just for
            comparison.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Attacking}\label{combat:attacking}
    A character (the attacker) can use 1 action to attack another character
    (the defender). The attacker must have the appropriate weapon equipped
    for the weapon skill they are using, or a free hand if they are using
    the hand-to-hand skill. The process of attacking is as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Attacker makes an attack roll (weapon skill check)
        \item Defender makes a defence roll (dodge, block, or parry check)
        \item If the attack roll is less than or equal to the defense roll, the
                attack fails. Otherwise, subtract the defense roll from the
                attack roll.
        \item If the remainder of the attack roll is less than or equal to the
                defender's armor rating, the armor's damage reduction will be
                subtracted from the attack damage.
        \item Roll for damage
        \item Subtract damage reduction if applicable
        \item Apply damage
    \end{itemize}

    Attacks made with a one-hand weapon being wielded in an off-hand take a -4
    penalty to the weapon skill check. An off-hand is considered to be any hand
    other than a character's main-hand, as specified during character creation.
    Most characters' main-hand is their right hand. An unarmed attack with an
    off-hand fist does not have such a penalty.

    A two-handed weapon does not have an off-hand penalty unless you choose to
    equip it backwards for some reason.

    \subsection{Dual-wielding}\label{combat:dual-wielding}
    A character can use 1 \textonehalf\ actions to make a dual-wielding
    attack. A dual-wielding attack is made with two separate weapons - or a
    double-ended weapons - that are currently equipped. This can include
    natural weapons that aren't being used to wield a weapon. In a
    dual-wielding attack, a character simply makes a separate attack with each
    weapon.

    An attacker with three or more equipped weapons may be able to make a
    triple, quadruple, or even greater multi-wield attack. For such an attack,
    follow the rules for a dual-wielding attack and add an extra cost of a
    \textonehalf\ action for each extra attack that is made.

    \subsection{Exotic wields}
    Two-handed weapons can be wielded one-handed. A two-handed melee weapon
    wielded one-handed has a -4 penalty to the attack roll in a character's
    main hand, and a -6 penalty in their off-hand. Two-handed ranged weapons
    cannot be wielded one-handed with only one hand or body part.

    Weapons can be wielded with body parts other than hands. If the body part
    can conceivably "grip" the weapon if enough force were applied (e.g. teeth,
    feet, or two body parts in combination such as elbows or knees) apply a -5
    penalty multiplied by the weapon's weight in lb. and rounded to a whole
    number in the negative direction. For two-handed weapons, double this
    penalty unless one of the body parts is a hand.

    \section{Moving}\label{combat:moving}
    During combat, a character can use 1 action to move a distance up to their
    speed rounded down to a multiple of 5 ft. (but always at least 5 ft.).
    Alternatively, they can use a \textonehalf\ action to move a distance up
    to half their speed rounded in the same way.

    A character can also cover large distances in a turn by sprinting.
    Sprinting costs the entire turn, and can only be done if the character has
    not yet spent any of their action allottment. By default, a character can
    move 4 times their speed by sprinting. A character cannot move a distance
    greater than they can sprint in a turn by using multiple actions to move.

    Moving provokes opportunity attacks if and only if moving \textit{away}
    from other creatures. The opportunity attack is provoked only at the
    point where the moving character is moving from a space in melee range of
    the provoked character to a space further away. If the opportunity attack
    results in the moving character becoming prone or grappled, that character
    immediately stops moving.

    Moving from a space in melee range of another creature to a space further
    away from that creature provokes an opportunity attack. Only one such
    movement provokes an opportunity attack per other creature per turn.

    \section{Opportunity Attacks}\label{combat:opportunity-attacks}
    Certain actions trigger opportunity attacks. When a character (the
    defender) makes such an action in melee range of another character (the
    attacker), the attacker may choose to make an opportunity attack. If they
    do, the attacker immediately makes an attack with a wielded melee weapon
    of choice against the defender. This attack takes place \textit{before}
    the defender carries out the action that triggered the opportunity attack.

    Certain combat skills can be used in place of an opportunity attack. These
    skills are grapple, trip, and disarm.

    By default each character can only make one opportunity attack per round.

    \section{Critical Hits}\label{combat:critical-hits}\index{critical hit}
    Critical hits represent especially successful attacks: those where luck and
    skill align to deal a devastating blow to an opponent e.g. striking a weak
    spot or finding a chink in armor.

    To make a critical hit, a character must first score a critical
    threat\index{critical threat} on an attack. An attack scores a critical
    threat if the natural roll (i.e. the number displayed on the d20 itself
    without modifiers) is within the weapon's critical range. Most weapons
    have a critical range of 20, in which case only a natural 20 scores a
    critical threat. Other critical ranges are listed in table
    \ref{tab:weapons} on page \pageref{tab:weapons}.

    On a critical threat, attacks automatically hit. If they would have hit
    anyway, they also bypass armor.

    Immediately after scoring a critical threat, and before rolling damage, a
    character makes a second attack check, but the target keeps their existing
    check. If the new attack check is a hit against the defence check, the
    critical threat is upgraded to a critical hit.

    A critical hit is an automatic hit, bypasses armor, and deals increased
    damage. Once a character confirms a critical hit, they roll for damage
    as normal, but multiply the result (of the entire damage formula including
    modifiers) by the weapon's critical damage multiplier. Multipliers are
    listed in table \ref{tab:weapons} on page \pageref{tab:weapons}.
