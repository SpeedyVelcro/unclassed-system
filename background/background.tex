\chapter{Background}\index{background}\label{background}
\begin{multicols*}{2}
    Backgrounds describe a character's past occupation. They grant numerous
    benefits - largely skill points and attribute modifiers - as well as
    penalties. They also determine your starting gold, and may grant some
    free pieces of starting equipment.

    By default, characters can choose whether to roll for starting gold or take
    the slightly reduced average given in brackets. The GM may require
    characters to use a specific method.

    \section{Multiple Backgrounds}
    Like cultures, a character can have multiple backgrounds. A character with
    multiple backgrounds retains all the effects of all backgrounds, and
    combines any free equipment and starting gold. A character must spend 1
    feat point for each background they choose beyond the first.
